   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clausewise-legal-analyzer.git
   cd clausewise-legal-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv clausewise_env

   # Windows
   clausewise_env\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   source clausewise_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

## 🚀 Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Upload Document**: Drag and drop or select a legal document (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)
2. **Choose Analysis Mode**: Navigate through the React tabs for various analysis types
3. **Review Results**: Examine simplified clauses, extracted entities, and document classification
4. **Review Results**: Compare plain-English clauses, entities, classifications, and risk signals

### Python API

```python
from clausewise_implementation import ClauseWiseAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = ClauseWiseAnalyzer()

# Analyze document
results = analyzer.analyze_document("path/to/your/document.pdf")

# Access specific analysis results
entities = results['entities']
clauses = results['clauses']
classification = results['classification']
summary = results['summary']
```
